            <h2>Just call me Zane</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Zane and I’m studying Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I love to play videogames and ride my motorcycle and enjoy being in the water. </p>
            <p>I am not married. </p>
            <p>I guess you could say that my current job is construction and I do excavation work</p>
            <p>but I want to do computer science because I always thought it was cool growing up.</p>
            <p>I love the location and the people here are BYU-I. Almost everyone I meet is amazing</p>
            <p>and super fun to be around.</p>
            <p>Every career needs a webpage just about so people can find it. Wouldn’t hurt to know how</p>
            <p>to make one or know how one is made even if you use a template or easy to build webpage.</p>
            <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life and a </p>
            <p>favorite scripture that I have is: </p>
            <p>"And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also." - 1 John 4:21</p>
